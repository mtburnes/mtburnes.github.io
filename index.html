    <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
     <!--<img src="" alt="Wow, what a good looking fella.">-->
      I am a Computer Science graduate from South City St. Louis, Missouri. I have a passion for all things computers, IT, and networking.
      Solving strange problems and creating cool services is what makes me tick. I am a programmer, musician, team-player, and occasional athlete.    
  </p>
  <p>
      I've been the "computer guy" for as long as I can remember.

      <!--<img src="" alt="Bishop DuBourg Jazz Band @ DuBourg Guild Theatre">-->
      I've been tought music since I could talk, and I began playing music during my sophomore year at Bishop DuBourg High School,
      and joined the Jazz band senior year. I got involved with the IT department, where I got my first taste of Windows Server and Active Directory
      management. 
  </p>
  <p title="I also know ActionScript but nobody uses Adobe Flash anymore so that's basically useless.">
      I have experence in C++, Java, JavaScript, and HTML as well as beginner's knowledge in Ruby. As for Cybersecurity work, I've extensively used
      Burp Suite and many CLI tools for application auditing.
