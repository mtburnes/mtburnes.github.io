        I am a Computer Science student based in South City St. Louis, Missouri. I have a passion for all things computers, IT, and networking.
        Solving strange problems and creating cool services is what makes me tick. I am a programmer, musician, team-player, and occasional athlete.

        I've been the "computer guy" for as long as I can remember.

        I've been tought music since I could talk, and I began playing music during my sophomore year at Bishop DuBourg High School,
        and joined the Jazz band senior year.
